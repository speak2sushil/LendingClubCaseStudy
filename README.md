# Lending Club Case Study
Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 

 

If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

 

In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## General Information
- In My Project i have added varous EDA techbique to find the driving factors behind loan default .
- Python 3.11 and imprtant liberaries like numpy , pandas and data visiulatization libe like matplot and seaborn
- THis analysis was done on loan data set 


## Conclusions
1.To sum up, the strong correlations between loan success and borrower behavior – such as repaying a significant portion of the principal, making larger total payments, paying higher sums to investors, and completing payments with a large final amount – indicate that these individuals possess financial stability and responsibility. From a lending perspective, these borrowers present lower risk.
2. Interpreting Negative Correlations in Loan Default Data
In your dataset, negative correlations have been observed between loan default rates and several factors, including lower recoveries, higher interest rates, larger loan amounts, higher credit utilization, recent credit inquiries, public records, and higher debt-to-income ratios. These factors are considered high-risk from a lending perspective, meaning borrowers exhibiting these characteristics are more likely to default on their loans.
